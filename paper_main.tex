\begin{abstract}
Cell type annotation in single-cell RNA sequencing requires complex pipelines combining multiple computational tools and extensive manual curation. We evaluate whether SCimilarity, a pre-trained foundation model, can approximate expert consensus annotations and enable robust cross-study label transfer in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using the AML scAtlas (159 patients, five studies), we demonstrate that SCimilarity achieves strong agreement with expert annotations on high-quality datasets (ARI=0.70) and substantially outperforms traditional reference-based classification for cross-study label transfer (ARI: 0.625 vs 0.430, +45\%), with particularly dramatic improvements for rare cell types (macro F1: 0.670 vs 0.315, +113\%). Controlled comparison of within-study versus cross-study transfer quantifies batch robustness: traditional methods lose 38\% of accuracy when batch effects are introduced, while SCimilarity loses only 20\%—nearly half the degradation. Direct batch correction benchmarking using standardized scib metrics shows SCimilarity performs competitively with scVI (0.692 vs 0.729) without dataset-specific training, achieving the highest biological conservation score (0.789). Performance varies across datasets, revealing quality-dependent automation potential. Our findings suggest foundation models offer a practical alternative to multi-tool consensus pipelines for high-quality data and provide superior batch-robust representations for cross-study annotation, particularly valuable for rare populations critical to AML biology.
